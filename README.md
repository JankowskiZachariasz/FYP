# FYP
This repository is my Java implementation of the famous SIFT algorithm. The photo below shows a map reconstructed from a series of photos generated by Unity simulation. The photos were simulating a visual input of a robot traversing a random path in the room on the left. My program would take the generated picture pairs, detect common features, triangulate them and slowly build a map that can be seen on the right.
